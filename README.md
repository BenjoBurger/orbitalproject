Proposed Level of Achievement: 

Apollo 11

Project Scope:
Make new dishes only using the ingredients you have. 

The app will receive input from the user on the ingredients they have, then by matching the ingredients to our database, we will give the user a list of dishes to choose from based on cuisine, ease of cooking etc. When the user has made a decision on what dish to try out, we will display the relevant information such as the ingredients required, steps and reviews of the dish by other users. 

Motivation

Do you ever find yourself bored of making the same dishes over and over again? After all, there are limitless combinations of exciting and novel recipes you could whip up instead of that egg fried rice for the 5th time this week. However, you may not always have time to run to the grocery store to prepare all the necessary ingredients, only to never use that one specific sauce or vegetable again.

Why isnâ€™t there an app that could source the internet new and interesting dishes you could prepare only with the ingredients that you have? Even better, why not share your dish recipes with your friends or our community?
